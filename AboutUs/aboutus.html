  <p>The Martyred Intellectuals Memorial is a memorial built in memory of the intellectuals who were killed by the Pakistani forces in the liberation war of Bangladesh on 14 December 1971. This memorial is located in Mohammadpur Thana area of Dhaka. The monument was designed by architects Farid U Ahmed and Jami Al Shafi. An initial proposal was made to build a memorial at Rayerbazar with the help of Generation 71, an organization of children martyred in the war of liberation, who laid a temporary foundation stone in 1991. In 1993, the Bangladesh government decided to build the memorial at the site of the massacre.</p>
